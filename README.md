# 2025 Code Night @ Schloss Gymnasium Mainz

This repository is supposed to contain code for the Code Night at the "Gymnasium am Kurfürstlichen Schloss Mainz". For 
this, a task for a two component microservice was designed, reproducing a simplified version of a car selling system, 
composed of a central server instance, which provides for a management of incoming and outgoing car part information as well as a
client instance, which retrieves data from the server and displays it to a client or worker at the car selling company. For more
information concerning the task, check out the [specifications](TASK.md).
